This open-source project aims to illustrate how to develop real-time applications on top of HANA. As an example application, this project is a i-Pad flight predictor application, based on historical data and real-time data (e.g., weather information) gathered from proper data sources.

Please note that the project is an on-going effort. The team will continuously upload related documents, to show and demonstrate how to develop HANA applications. Some documents may have evolving versions.

-Architectural design document
